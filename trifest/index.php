We wanted to make you aware of an exciting opportunity we are having at TriTech Skills Center. 
We want to partner with community-focused individuals and businesses to show our students how 
they can contribute after they graduate. We are planning a two-day competition, and we’re looking 
for volunteers for our panel of judges. 

We have two sessions planned from 8:00-10:30 and 11:30-2:00 on Thursday, November 9. 
Our competition will focus around the simulation of a small business who wants to contribute to their local community. 
Our student groups will be tasked with developing a plan for their business. 
We would love to have you participate in this great event. As our students go out into the workforce over the next several years, 
we want to instill a desire for community contribution. Having someone such as yourself there to represent exactly those ideals 
would be a tremendous help in our effort! You may choose to attend one or two sessions.  AM and/or PM. Let us know what works best for you!
 
If you are at all interested in signing up or would just like to hear more about this event, please let us know. Thanks!​
